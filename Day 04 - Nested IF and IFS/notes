# Day 04 – Nested IF & IFS

## What I Learned
- Learned how to use **nested IF** to handle multiple conditions in a single formula.
- Learned the difference between **nested IF** and **IFS** for logical testing.
- Understood when it is better to use nested IF versus IFS for readability and simplicity.

## Functions / Features
- `=IF(logical_test, value_if_true, IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false))`
- `=IFS(logical_test1, value_if_true1, logical_test2, value_if_true2, ...)`

## Practice
- Created small practice cases to compare nested IF and IFS formulas.
- Tested multiple conditions to classify data based on predefined rules.

## Key Takeaways
- Nested IF can handle complex logic but becomes harder to read when conditions increase.
- IFS is more readable and suitable for multiple conditions without needing nested formulas.
- Choosing the right function improves formula clarity and maintainability.
