# Day 06 – IF with AND, OR, LEFT, MID, RIGHT

## What I Learned
- Learned how to combine **IF** with **AND** and **OR** to handle multiple logical conditions.
- Learned how to use **LEFT**, **MID**, and **RIGHT** to extract specific text from cells.
- Applied text functions together with logical functions to solve conditional cases.

## Functions / Features
- `=IF(AND(condition1, condition2), value_if_true, value_if_false)`
- `=IF(OR(condition1, condition2), value_if_true, value_if_false)`
- `=LEFT(text, num_chars)`
- `=MID(text, start_num, num_chars)`
- `=RIGHT(text, num_chars)`

## Practice
- Created practice cases using IF combined with AND and OR to classify data.
- Used LEFT, MID, and RIGHT functions to extract text values and apply conditions based on the extracted results.

## Key Takeaways
- **AND** requires all conditions to be TRUE, while **OR** only requires one condition to be TRUE.
- Text functions are useful when conditions depend on specific characters or codes within a cell.
- Combining logical and text functions allows more flexible and powerful data analysis.
