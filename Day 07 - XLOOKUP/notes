# Day 07 – XLOOKUP

## What I Learned
- Learned how to use **XLOOKUP** as an improved and more flexible replacement for VLOOKUP.
- Understood the role of **lookup_array** and **return_array** in XLOOKUP.
- Learned how XLOOKUP solves limitations found in VLOOKUP, such as column order dependency.

## Functions / Features
- `=XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode])`

### Parameter Explanation
- **lookup_array** → The reference table or range where the lookup value is searched.
- **return_array** → The reference table or range containing the value to return.
- Parameters inside **[ ]** are optional and do not need to be filled.
- To skip optional parameters, simply use a comma (**`,`**).

## Practice
- Created simple practice cases using XLOOKUP to retrieve data from tables.
- Compared XLOOKUP results with VLOOKUP to understand the differences.

## Key Takeaways
- XLOOKUP does not require counting column positions like VLOOKUP.
- Optional parameters can be skipped using commas if not needed.
- Always read the function rules carefully (e.g. **-1**, **0**, **1**) to understand how matching and searching work.
- XLOOKUP is more flexible, readable, and safer for reporting purposes.
