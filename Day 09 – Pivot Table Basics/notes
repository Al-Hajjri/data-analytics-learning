# Day 09 – Pivot Table Basics

## What I Learned
- Learned the basic concept of **Pivot Table** to summarize and analyze data efficiently.
- Learned how to create a Pivot Table by selecting the data range to be analyzed.
- Understood how to choose which fields are displayed as rows, columns, values, and filters.

## Functions / Features
- **Rows** → Display data vertically (downwards).
- **Columns** → Display data horizontally (sideways).
- **Values** → Show calculated results such as sum, count, or average.
- **Filters** → Filter data based on selected criteria.
- **Grand Total** → Automatically added to show total values.

## Practice
- Selected the target dataset and created a Pivot Table.
- Assigned specific fields to Rows, Columns, and Values to analyze the data.
- Used filters to display specific data:
  - Filtered a single item by selecting it and clicking OK.
  - Enabled **Select Multiple Items** to filter more than one data value.

## Key Takeaways
- Pivot Tables make data summarization faster without using complex formulas.
- Rows and Columns control how data is displayed vertically and horizontally.
- Filters help focus on specific data segments.
- Pivot Tables automatically calculate totals, making them ideal for reporting.
