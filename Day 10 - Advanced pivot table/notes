# Day 10 – Pivot Table Advanced (Calculated Field & Value Settings)

## What I Learned
- Learned how to create a new field in a Pivot Table using **Calculated Field**.
- Learned how to sort Pivot Table values from smallest to largest and vice versa.
- Learned how to change the default value calculation from **SUM** to other calculations.
- Learned how to rank data in a Pivot Table using **Show Values As**.

## Functions / Features
- **Calculated Field**
  - PivotTable Analyze → Fields, Items & Sets → Calculated Field
  - Define a new field name and apply a formula.
- **Value Field Settings**
  - Change calculation type (Sum, Average, Max, Min, Count, etc.).
- **Sorting**
  - Sort values in ascending or descending order.
- **Show Values As**
  - Display values as rank, percentage, or other calculated views.

## Practice
- Added a new calculated field to create custom calculations in a Pivot Table.
- Changed value settings from the default **Sum** to **Average**, **Max**, and **Min**.
- Sorted Pivot Table results to identify highest and lowest values.
- Applied **Show Values As** to rank data within the Pivot Table.

## Key Takeaways
- Calculated Fields allow additional analysis without modifying the source data.
- Value Field Settings provide flexibility in how data is summarized.
- Sorting helps quickly identify top and bottom performers.
- **Show Values As** is useful for ranking and comparative analysis in reports.
