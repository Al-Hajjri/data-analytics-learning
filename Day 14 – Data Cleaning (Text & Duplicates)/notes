# Day 14 – Data Cleaning (Text & Duplicates)

## What I Learned
Today I learned basic data cleaning techniques in Excel to improve data consistency and readability. The focus was on cleaning text data, combining columns, and removing duplicate values.

## Functions / Features

### Text Cleaning
- `TRIM()` → Removes extra spaces (leading, trailing, and double spaces)
- `UPPER()` → Converts text to uppercase
- `LOWER()` → Converts text to lowercase
- `PROPER()` → Capitalizes the first letter of each word

### Combine Data (Concatenate)
- `=CONCATENATE(A18,B18)` → Combines text from multiple cells
- Add space between text using `" "`  
  Example:  
  `=CONCATENATE(A18," ",B18)`
- Alternative method using `&` (more commonly used):  
  `=A18 & " " & B18`

### Remove Duplicates
- Shortcut method:
  - `Ctrl + A`
  - `Alt + A + M`
  - Select the column(s) to remove duplicates
- Menu method:
  - Select the data
  - Go to **Data** tab
  - Click **Remove Duplicates**
  - Choose the column(s) and confirm

## Practice
- Cleaned inconsistent text using TRIM, UPPER, LOWER, and PROPER
- Combined first name and last name into one column
- Removed duplicate data from selected columns

## Key Takeaways
- Clean text data first before doing analysis or reporting
- Use `" "` to add space when combining text
- The `&` operator is simpler and more flexible than CONCATENATE
- Always check selected columns before removing duplicates to avoid data loss
