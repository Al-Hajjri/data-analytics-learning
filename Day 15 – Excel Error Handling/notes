# Day 15 – Excel Error Handling

## What I Learned
Today I learned how to identify and understand common error types in Excel, including the causes of each error and how they usually occur during data processing and analysis.

## Error Types & Causes

- **#N/A**
  - Occurs when data is not found.
  - Commonly happens when using **VLOOKUP** or **HLOOKUP** and the lookup value does not exist in the reference table.

- **#DIV/0!**
  - Occurs when dividing a number by zero.

- **#NAME?**
  - Occurs due to a typo in a formula or when Excel does not recognize the function name.

- **#NUM!**
  - Occurs when a formula contains invalid numeric values or does not meet mathematical logic.

- **#VALUE!**
  - Occurs when Excel tries to perform calculations using incompatible data types (e.g. adding numbers with text).

- **#REF!**
  - Occurs when a referenced cell is deleted after the formula has been created.

- **#####**
  - Occurs when a column is not wide enough to display the value.

- **#CALC!**
  - Occurs due to calculation errors, commonly in dynamic array formulas (e.g. FILTER) when the result does not exist in the reference table.

## Practice
- Observed and tested different error types by creating simple examples.
- Identified the root cause of each error based on the formula used.

## Key Takeaways
- Understanding error messages helps troubleshoot formulas faster.
- Many errors come from missing data, incorrect references, or wrong data types.
- Always check formula logic and referenced cells to prevent errors.
